## AI & LLM Subscriptions (As of February 2026)

**Important Context: Coach has PAID subscriptions - no per-token costs!**

### Active Paid Subscriptions

1. **Google Anti-gravity Ultra**
   - Status: PAID subscription (monthly)
   - Access via: OAuth (faithinmotion88@gmail.com)
   - Models included:
     - Claude Opus 4.5 Thinking
     - Claude Sonnet 4.5 Thinking (PRIMARY MODEL)
     - Claude Sonnet 4.5
     - Gemini 3 Pro High
     - Gemini 3 Pro Low
     - Gemini 3 Flash
     - GPT OSS 120B Medium

2. **Anthropic Claude Pro**
   - Tier: Pro ($20/month)
   - Access via: Direct API token
   - Models included:
     - Claude Sonnet 4.5
     - Claude Haiku 4
   - Cost structure: SUBSCRIPTION = $0 per token (~5x free tier usage)

### Strategic Implications

**Critical understanding:**
- Using paid models = NO additional cost (already paid subscription)
- NOT using paid models = WASTED money (subscription already purchased)
- Free local models should supplement, NOT replace paid models

**Model usage philosophy:**
1. **Primary (90% of work):** Use PAID premium models
   - Claude Sonnet 4.5 Thinking (best reasoning)
   - Gemini 3 Pro (complex tasks)
   - Quality and reliability most important for autonomous operations
   
2. **Supplementary (10% of work):** Use FREE local models
   - Simple tasks (Qwen Coder 3B for syntax fixes)
   - Quick math (DeepSeek R1 7B)
   - Testing/experimentation
   - Speed optimization for trivial tasks

**Coach's preference:** Quality > cost (he already invested in premium subscriptions)

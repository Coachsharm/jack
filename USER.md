- **Error Suppression:** DO NOT show tool errors to Coach. Handle them internally or report simply.
- **Backups:** When Coach says "backup Jack" — ask which option first:
  - **Option 1: Config files only**
  - **Option 2: Full backup**
- **Voice-to-text:** Coach often uses speech-to-text which can produce garbled text. ALWAYS sanity-check the message before acting.
- **Inline buttons:** Whenever presenting options, use Telegram inline buttons. See `lessons/inline-buttons-telegram.md`.

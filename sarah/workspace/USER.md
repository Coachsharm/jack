## Communication Preferences
- **Voice-to-text:** Coach often uses speech-to-text which can produce garbled or nonsensical text. ALWAYS sanity-check the message before acting. If something looks risky, destructive, or doesn't make sense — confirm with Coach first. Never assume. Communication must be solid.
- **Inline buttons:** Whenever presenting options or choices to Coach, use Telegram inline buttons so he can just tap instead of typing. Format: `[[{"text": "Label", "callback_data": "value"}]]`
- **Technical topics:** Keep it simple unless Coach asks for detail.

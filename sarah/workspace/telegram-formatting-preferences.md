## ❌ NEVER USE MARKDOWN TABLES ON TELEGRAM

**Tables break on mobile!** They render as broken, unreadable garbage.

**Instead use:**
- Bullet lists
- Simple text comparisons
- Line-by-line format

**Example - DON'T:**
```
| Exercise | Sets | Reps | Rest |
|----------|------|------|------|
| Squat    | 4    | 8    | 90s  |
```

**Example - DO:**
```
**Squat:**
- 4 sets x 8 reps
- Rest: 90 seconds
- Tempo: 3-1-2

**Bench Press:**
- 3 sets x 10 reps
- Rest: 60 seconds
```

## The Goldilocks Rule

Not too cramped ❌ Not too spaced ❌ Just right ✅

## Perfect Spacing Formula

**Section headers:**
- Blank line BEFORE header
- Blank line AFTER header

**List items within same section:**
- NO blank lines between items
- Keep them grouped together

**Between different sections/groups:**
- ONE blank line to separate

## Rules Summary

1. **NEVER USE MARKDOWN TABLES** - breaks on mobile
2. Headers get breathing room (blank line before + after)
3. Related items stay together (no blanks between)
4. Different topics get separated (one blank line)
5. Never double-space between items in a list
6. Never pack everything with no breaks
